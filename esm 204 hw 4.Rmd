```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Attach packages

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
# Read in data
damages <- read_csv(here("damages.csv"))
warming <- read_csv(here("warming.csv"))
```

1. Using damages.csv, estimate a quadratic damage function relating the dollar value of damages to the change in global mean temperature. Estimate a model with a zero intercept because damages by construction must equal zero when there is no climate change. Plot your estimated damage function, overlaid with a scatterplot of the underlying data.

```{r}

# Need warming^2 to derive a quadratic model

damages$warming2 <- damages$warming^2

#run a linear regression
damages_quadratic <- lm(damages ~ 0 + warming + warming2, data = damages)

#output the model results
summary(damages_quadratic)
```
